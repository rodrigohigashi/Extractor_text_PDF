# PDF to TXT Converter – Made with Streamlit 💻

This app receives a PDF file, extracts the text, and generates a `.txt` file for download.

It was created to make life easier for professionals who work with many PDF files and need to extract their content (for copying into a system or organizing into a database, for example).

The app is entirely free and was developed by Rodrigo Higashi.

## How to Use

1. Upload the PDF file.
2. Click the **"Convert PDF to TXT"** button.
3. Once the text is extracted, you can view it on the screen and download the `.txt` file.
